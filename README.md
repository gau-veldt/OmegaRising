# OmegaRising
Godot Client (and core server sources) for Omega Rising online RPG

Omega Rising is a multiplayer RPG engine server and client using the
Godot game engine (https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

Omega Rising client and server are now using Godot 2.2's networking API.
Assets (and patching) are to be managed by a separate webserver (not
included) to allow the bandwidth and performance requirements of an asset
server to be factored out from the server machine.
