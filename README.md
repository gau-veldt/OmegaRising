Godot Client (and core server sources) for Omega Rising online RPG

Omega Rising is a multiplayer RPG engine server and client using the
Godot game engine (https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

Suports server/client asset updating (eg: "patching") via TCP with
game messages transferred via UDP for lower latency and less lag.
